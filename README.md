# git-agent

Git agent would answer various questions based on the log of commit messages and code diffs. Following are some of the examples:

Code Contribution Analysis: Who are the top contributors to this repository?

Bug Fix Identification: Which commits in the last week addressed reported bugs?

Feature Development Tracking: What features were added or removed in the last month?

Code Quality Metrics: What is the trend of code complexity over the last six months?

Release Note Generation: Generate release notes based on the commits since the last release.

Issue Closure Prediction: Based on past data, when is the estimated time for issue closure?

Code Ownership Identification: Who are the primary maintainers of this specific module or file?

Hotspot Analysis: Identify areas of the codebase that have been frequently modified recently.

Developer Activity Tracking: How active has each developer been in terms of commits and reviews over the past quarter?

## Architecture

For building agent workflow, planning, creating task, execution and feedback are crucial part of the architecture.

For long term memory, a vectorstore would be used.
